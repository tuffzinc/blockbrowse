## 🚀 About the Project

This is a static build of the **Scramjet** internet proxy, originally developed by **MercuryWorkshop**. This deployment is powered by a public WISP libcurl URL provided by **aura.pro**. 

This static variant is built on Scramjet version 1.10 and utilizes the core engine components directly from the official Scramjet Example-App, allowing it to remain entirely static.

## 🤝 Credits & Acknowledgments

* **MercuryWorkshop:** For creating the Scramjet proxy, supplying the essential engine files, and developing the WISP server and libcurl transport layers utilized by Scramjet.
* **Aura Team:** For hosting and providing the public WISP/libcurl server that `SJ-static` connects to, keeping this project serverless and static.

TIP: the default scramjet-static program uses the public WISP aura.pro server link, it is highly suggested to experiment with other WISP backend URL's (including your own) to maxmize security, speed, and other config to your liking, the default aura.pro URL is used in the public build of scramjet-static and replacment is un-needed, although not a bad idea for public deployment.
